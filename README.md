# ScrapChests
Risk of Rain 2 mod to add the Artifact of Debris, which changes all items from chests into scrap to be printed.

No longer breaks Artifact of Evolution :) (or the void fields)

Contains support for LunarScrap, download it over at https://thunderstore.io/package/Windows10CE/LunarScrap/

Credit for the icon all go to @breadguy#5000 on the modding Discord, it would've stayed the vanilla white scrap icon forever if not for him.
